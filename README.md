# Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader Quiz

Within this assignment we were asked to make a quiz out using CSS, Javascript, and HTML. What I did first was figure out the design of the website, and then went into the meat of the coding, where I started added fucntions for different items. 
For this website, I had difficulties with implementing the highest score towards the end because I did run out of time (once again my fault), but also figuring out the button placements was difficult also. Within this program, there are 3 buttons,
along with 3 different types of screens. A started screen, a quiz screen where it would transition between the 10 questions provided and also tell you if you are right or wrong. And then the ending screen where it tells you your score and asks you to 
add your name into an input text and it is suppose to display the name along with score.
